       <h1> UNIVERSE : </h1>
	   <p>
The universe is the name that we use to describe the collection of all the things that exist in space. <br>
It is made of many millions of millions of stars and planets and enormous clouds of gas <br>
 Astronomers can use telescopes to look at very distant galaxies.<br>
       
 The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
 It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,<br>
 with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. <br>
 It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. 
    <br>
 The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth and is the planet's only natural satellite. <br>
 It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System,<br>
 and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits.
